# Backend Interview Exercise 

## What to code

The exercise is to create and update a few additional models and API endpoints.  Please complete all of the numbered tasks below.

### Models

1. Create a `Course` model that represents a specific course/semester.

    - Properties:
        - name
        - location - example: "Room 123"

2. Create one or more models to represent school administrators, teachers and students.

    - Properties:
        - name

3. Create the following relationships between the previous models

    - A course can have 0-1 teachers
    - A course can have 0-many students
    - Each of the new models must be related to 1 `School` (model provided)
    

### REST API

1. Create separate CRUD endpoints for the following

    - courses
    - admins
    - teachers
    - students

2. Add `GET /api/schools/:schoolId:/stats` which returns a JSON response with the following:

    ```
    {
        id: <schoolId>,
        courses: <# of courses>,
        admins: <# of admins>,
        teachers: <# of teachers>,
        students: <# of students>
    }
    ```

3. Create an endpoint `POST /api/transfer` that moves a student from one class to another.

    ```
    # Request body
    {
        studentId: <studentId>,
        fromCourseId: <current course ID>,
        toCourseId: <target course ID>
    }
    ```


## Doing the exercise

This repository uses Docker and docker-compose to spin up two containers.  One is a PostgreSQL database, and the other is a Python Django 4 application.

### Setup

1. To create the environment, run `docker-compose up -d` in the root directory of this repo.

    > M1 Mac users can run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.m1.yml up -d` instead.

2. Once the container is up and running, you will need to create a root user.  Run the following command and follow the prompts: `docker exec -it <container_name> poetry run python manage.py createsuperuser`

3. You can view the Django admin at `http://localhost:8000/admin` using your new superuser credentials.


## Evaluation

We will use the following process to verify your work

1. Boot up the docker containers
2. Run/verify Django database migrations
3. Create some data using the Django admin tool
4. Evaluate the endpoints with a few test scenarios

Your implementation will also be evaluated against the following criteria:

- it has to work
- cleanliness and readability of code
- creativity - It's great to show off interesting implementations, but stick to the objectives.  This exercise should not take too long, so don't feel the need to add extra features.
